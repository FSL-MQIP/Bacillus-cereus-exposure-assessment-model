Title: Development of a Bacillus cereus exposure assessment model 

In this project, a genomics based Bacillus cereus exposure assessment model was developed to assess human exposure to B cereus by consumption of HTST milk contaminated with different B cereus subtypes.

The main model file is named "BCereusModel.RMD".

The R script named "UtilityFunctions.R" includes all the functions needed for primary growth model and will be called inside the main model file.

The model input including the growth data of 17 B cereus isolates are located in "InputFile".
