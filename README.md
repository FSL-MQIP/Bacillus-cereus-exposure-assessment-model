Title: Development of a Bacillus cereus exposure assessment model 

In this project, a genomics based Bacillus cereus exposure assessment model was developed to assess human exposure to B cereus by consumption of HTST milk contaminated with different B cereus subtypes.

The R script named "Primary Growth Model Fitting.R" includes the R code for primary growth model fitting.

The R script named "UtilityFunctions.R" includes five primary growth models (Buchanan, Gompertz, Baranyi, Buchanan_without_lag, Baranyi_without_lag).

The model input including the growth data of 17 B cereus isolates are located in "InputFiles".

The estimated growth parameters (including the weighted averages), AIC, BIC and RMSE results are located in "OutputFiles".
